### **Part 1: Key Economic Sectors for SMEs in the UAE**

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the foundation of the UAE's economy, contributing approximately 63.5% to the country's non-oil GDP.1 While the user-specified sectors of

**Hospitality, Construction, Real Estate, Education, Health, Logistics, and Retail** are all significant, analysis of economic data confirms their importance and highlights others.

The primary SME sectors in the UAE, based on their contribution to enterprise numbers, employment, and GDP, are:

* **Trading (Retail & Wholesale):** This is the largest sector for SMEs in Dubai, accounting for 57% of all SME establishments.2 Retail trade employs over 25% of the entire SME workforce in the UAE.3  
* **Services:** This broad category accounts for 35% of SMEs in Dubai and employs 51% of the SME workforce.2 It includes several key sub-sectors:  
  * **Real Estate, Renting, and Business Services:** This is the largest sub-sector within services.2  
  * **Construction:** A major contributor to both employment and productivity.3  
  * **Hospitality (Hotels & Restaurants):** A vital and highly productive SME segment.3  
  * **Logistics (Transportation):** A key service industry with a high propensity for capital investment.2  
  * **Professional, Scientific, and Technical Consultancies:** These SMEs are noted for being highly productive, even more so than their larger counterparts.3  
  * **Health and Education:** These fall under the broader services umbrella and are critical to the social infrastructure.  
* **Manufacturing:** This sector represents 8% of SMEs in Dubai and is a strategic priority for the government, with a goal to increase its contribution to the national GDP to 25% by 2025\.2
